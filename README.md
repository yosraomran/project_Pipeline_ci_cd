# Project Pipeline CI/CD

Mise en place d'une pipeline DevOps avec des tests automatis√©s.

## Prerequisites
- Java 17
- JDK 17
- Spring Boot 3.2.2

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Set up GitHub Repository
Create a new GitHub repository for your Spring Boot application project.

### Step 2: Create GitHub Actions Workflow
Create a new file called `.github/workflows/maven.yml` in the root directory of your project. This file will contain the instructions for building and testing your application.

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v2
        with:
          java-version: '17'
      - name: Cache Maven packages
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: ~/.m2
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-m2-${{ hashFiles('**/pom.xml') }}
          restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-m2
      - name: Build with Maven
        run: |
          mvn clean
          mvn -B package --file pom.xml

  test:
    name: Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [build]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v2
        with:
          java-version: '17'
      - name: Run automated tests
        run: |
          mvn test

  deployment:
    name: Deployment
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [test]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build the Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          context: .
          dockerfile: Dockerfile
          push: false
          tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}/devops-pipeline:v1.0.0

      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN }}

      - name: Push the Docker image to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          context: .
          dockerfile: Dockerfile
          push: true
          tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}/devops-pipeline:v1.0.0
````
  

This maven.yml file sets up a workflow that runs on every push to the main branch. It has one job:

build and test the application.

## Step 4: Push to Github Repository
Commit and push your changes to your Github repository. The Github Actions workflow should automatically trigger.
